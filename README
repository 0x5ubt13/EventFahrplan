CampFahrplan
============

CampFahrplan is a viewer for schedules of Chaos Computer Club e.V. events such as
Chaos Communication Camp or Chaos Communication Congress.
  
In addition to an daily overview of talks, the app lets you read the abstracts, 
highlight talks, add a talk to your calendar, share talks with others, and 
set reminders within the app.
